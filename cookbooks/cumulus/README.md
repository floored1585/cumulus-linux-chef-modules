Usage
-----
### Recipes
-----
#### cumulus::switchd

Provides a Chef service resource for the Cumulus Networks switchd daemon.

On its own this recipe does nothing, but can be used with the Cumulus resource providers to restart switchd when the systemc configuration changes.

#### cumulus::interfaces

Provides a Chef service resource for the networking service, and configures the system for network interfaces configuration fragments.

By default the recipe creates the fragments directory specifed in `node['cumulus']['interfaces']['dir']` attribute, then uses `ifquery` to extract the current configuration for the `eth0` and `lo` interfaces. The current `/etc/network/interfaces` file is then over-written with one that uses configuration fragments.

This recipe is intended to be used with the `cumulus_interfaces_policy` and `cumulus_interface`, `cumulus_bridge` & `cumulus_bond` providers to manage your network interfaces. Used alone it will over-write any existing configuration in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

#### cumulus::default

Includes both the `interfaces` & `switchd` recipes. 
Just include `cumulus` in your node's `run_list`:

```json
{
  "name":"my_node",
  "run_list": [
    "recipe[cumulus]"
  ]
}
```

### Definitions
----
#### cumulus_ports

Configure the switch ports on a Trident2 switch.

##### Parameters:

* `name` - Name for the resource. This is not directly used by the provider.
* `speed_10g` - Array of ports to be configured for 10GbE.
* `speed_40g ` - Array of ports to be configured for 40GbE.
* `speed_40_div_4` - Array of ports to be configured for 40GbE split to 4 x 10GbE.
* `speed_4_by_10g` - Array of ports to be configured for 10GbE to be aggregated into 1 x 40GbE.

##### Examples:

Configure `swp1` as a 10GbE port, `swp3`, `swp5` through `swp10` and `swp12` as 40GbE ports, `swp15` & `swp16` as 4 x 10GbE ports and `swp20` through `swp32` as 1 x 40GbE aggregate ports.

```ruby
cumulus_ports 'speeds' do
  speed_10g ['swp1']
  speed_40g ['swp3','swp5-10', 'swp12']
  speed_40g_div_4 ['swp15','swp16']
  speed_4_by_10g ['swp20-32']
  notifies :restart, "service[switchd]"
end
```

#### cumulus_license

Installs a Cumulus Linux license file on a Cumulus Linux switch.

If a license is already installed the provider will check that it has expired before replacing it. You can over-ride this behaviour with the `force` parameter.

The provider uses the `cl-license` command to validate and install the license file.

##### Parameters:

* `name` - Name for the resource. This is not directly used by the provider.
* `source` - URL to the license file to be installed. Must be a valid HTTP resource.
* `force` - If `true`, skip the license expiration check and install the new license regardless of any current license. Default is `false`.

##### Examples:

Install a license file if one is not already installed:

```ruby
cumulus_license 'example' do
  source 'http://example.com/cumulus.lic'
  notifies :restart, "service[switchd]"
end
```

Install a license file, over-writting any existing license:

```ruby
cumulus_license 'example' do
  source 'http://example.com/cumulus.lic'
  force true
  notifies :restart, "service[switchd]"
end
```

#### cumulus_interface_policy

Manage the interface configuration snippets. The provided list of interfaces is compared to the contents of the configuration directory. Any configuration files which exist on disk but are not in the list of interfaces are deleted. This allows you to ensure that no unmanaged interface configurations are installed.

Note that this includes interfaces such as `eth0` and `lo`, so these interfaces must be included in the `allowed` list or strange things may happen.

##### Parameters:

* `name` - Name for the resource. This is not directly used by the provider.
* `allowed` - Array of interface names that you are managing with Chef. Any configurations that are not listed will be deleted.
* `location` - Location of the configuration snippets directory. Default is the directory set by the `node['cumulus']['interfaces']['dir']` attribute.

##### Examples:

Manage `eth0`, `lo`, `swp1` though `swp32`, `bond0` through `bond25` and `br0`:

````ruby
cumulus_interface_policy 'policy' do
  allowed ['eth0', 'lo', 'swp1-32', 'bond0-25', 'br0']
  notifies :reload, "service[networking]"
end
````

#### cumulus_interface

Manage a network interface using the ifupdown2 `ifquery` tool. The configuration for the interface will be written to a fragment under the interface configurations fragments directory.

##### Parameters:

* `name` - Identifier for the interface.
* `ipv4` - Array of IPv4 addresses to be applied to the interface.
* `ipv6` - Array of IPv6 addresses to be applied to the interface.
* `alias_name` - Interface alias.
* `addr_method` - Address assignment method, `dhcp`, `static` or `loopback`. Default is empty, I.e. no address method is set.
* `speed` - The interface link speed.
* `mtu` - The interface Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
* `virtual_ip` - VRR virtual IP
* `virtual_mac` - VRR virtual MAC
* `vids` - Array of VLANs to be configured for a VLAN aware trunk interface.
* `pvid` - Native VLAN for a VLAN aware trunk interface.
* `location` - Location of the configuration snippets directory. Default is the directory set by the `node['cumulus']['interfaces']['dir']` attribute.
* `mstpctl_portnetwork` - Enable bridge assurance on a VLAN aware trunk.
* `mstpctl_bpduguard` - Enable BPDU guard on a VLAN aware trunk.

The following CLAG related attributes are also available. If CLAG is enabled, `clagd_enable`, `clagd_priority`, `clagd_peer_id` and `clagd_sys_mac` should all be provided:

* `clagd_enable` - Enable the clagd daemon.
* `clagd_priority` - Set the CLAG priority for this switch.
* `clagd_peer_id` - Address of the CLAG peer switch.
* `clagd_sys_mac` - CLAG system MAC. The MAC must be identical on both of the CLAG peers.
* `clagd_args` - Any additional arguments to be passed to the clagd deamon.

##### Examples:
